BLEngine Procedures
---------------------

Procedures are special functions that interact with a connected device instance. 
Each such function takes at least one parameter being the device instance to communicate with.
Then, there might be other parameters depending on the function itself.

Procedures can be executed from the CLI in a standard way. They can also be directly called
within a Python script.
