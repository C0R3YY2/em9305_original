=====================
Packets & Procedures
=====================

The engine have internal fast lookup dictionaries to store defined Packets and high-level functionalities known as Procedures.

Commands and Events Defintions
-------------------------------

BLEngine contain all the packets definitions that the engine need to know (that means a lot of packets)!

The main purpose is to act like a super-fast knowledge base when sending or receiving data, to be more human friendly (e.g., give the name of the packet instead of the raw opcode). It's also where the engine look for a specific packet name (e.g. when using ``engine.send("CRAZY_PACKET")``).

This list is automatically generated, the hierarchy is given by HCI-encapsulation (e.g. a Command Packet will be encapsulated in a HCI Command packet).

The packet list can take some time to load, and since all packets are in one big file, we recommend you to use your browser search function (e.g. ``ctrl-f``).

Each entry provide a little example on how to use it.

Procedures Definitions
------------------------------

The procedures Registry store various functions which provide some high-level functionalities to abstract simple tasks.

Some kind of grouping will be available soon, for the time being it's a flat list.
