# Installation

## Distribution Package

The standalone "distribution" package provide a windows executable which can be used via Command Line Interface and a compiled python module which is required to execute, and be imported in, python scripts. 

### Installation

The distribution package provides a Windows-Only PowerShell setup script, which takes care of system-wide management of both executable and/or python module. This script does not need administrator rights if default installation folder is choosen.

To launch the installer, open the "setup.lnk" shortcut or execute directly `setup.ps1` with PowerShell (either by a right-click on it or from a console) and follow the instructions. 

This setup script takes care of installation/update/removal of the blengine folder along with user Path/PythonPath update.

### Windows and Linux Executable

Once installed, blengine executable can be called system-wide and replace any call to `python blengine_cli.py ...` and/or `python -m blengine ...` by `blengine.exe ...`, this is valid for all the code examples in this documentation.

To check if the installation is successfull, open a terminal and run `blengine --version`. you should see a welcome message and the actual version of blengine,

More information about the executable usage is available in the [Usage](./Usage.md) section, all of the CLI commands in this documentation shall be executed as is after installation.

### Python module

The BLEngine python module is build and tested again Python versions 3.8 to 3.11 on Windows and Linux platforms.

To check if the installation is successfull, open a terminal and run ` python -c "import blengine; print(blengine.__version__)"`. you should see blengine's version number.

Once installed, blengine python module can be imported in any python script on your system. You should be able to run the python scripts from any environment.

### Proper way to install Python on windows

The recommended windows python installation steps are the following :

1. Download and execute any windows installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.
2. DO NOT tick "Install for All Users" checkbox, otherwise it will require administrator rights.
3. DO NOT tick "Add Python to your path" checkbox.
4. Choose "Advanced installation" and untick ONLY "Python Test Suite".
5. Continue installation with default parameters.

This method allow for multiple versions of python to be available at the same time, each one with their own packages.

Then just call the `py` command with the version you want, e.g. `py -3.10` or `py -3.9`, run `py -0` to list available versions.
