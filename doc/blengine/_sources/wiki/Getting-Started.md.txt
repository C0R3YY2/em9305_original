# Getting Started

So after following the [Installation](./Installation.md) procedure corresponding to the installation package, you want to check that everything is working.

This page gives a high-level overview of a fraction of blengine features, please read more about configuration in [Configuration page](./Configuration.md), and more about general usage in [Usage page](./Usage.md).


## CLI Usage and installation package

Depending on the way you use BLEngine you'll be able to use the executable or the python module.

### Installation from distribution package

You should be able to call `blengine.exe` from any command prompt, since it is in your PATH.

### Installation from PIP or Git

After installing the package with `pip install -e .`, you should have an up and running blengine available in your environnement.

## Installation Check-up

After connecting a device, with a specified COM port. You can use the `--port` argument to make quick tests without needing a custom configuration file.

The following command gathers some informations about the connected device using the `get_local_device_infos` procedures, which will show all kind of information concerning the device, connected on COM22 in this example.

```
> blengine --port=COM22 run hci.get_local_device_infos

{'DVK': b'EM9305_DVK',
 'DVK_Hardware_Version': None,
 'DVK_Serial': 'f500198557f5e3d4aefc050917009027',
 'DVK_Software_Version': b'v1.4.0',
 'Firmware': 'ROM',
 'NPRAM_Used': 6696,
 'PRAM_Reserved': 4096,
 'PRAM_Used': 416,
 'RAM_Pool_Size': 61440}

```

Getting a json-like output with some informations is a very good sign that the communication between blengine and your device is well established.

## Configuration initialization and customization

BLEngine comes with a default configuration living inside the installation or package folder. To customize this configuration to be suitable for your needs, blengine provide a `config` command which will create the files needed. The following command will create configuration files in your current working directory.

```
> blengine config --init

Copying C:\Users\cborel\AppData\BLEngine\config to current working dir (C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine)
C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\config.cfg
C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\nvm_infos\EM9305\configurations.json
C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\nvm_infos\EM9305\nvm_default_data.json
C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\nvm_infos\EM9305\nvm_descriptions.json
C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\nvm_infos\EM9305\registers.json
> creating local config file C:\Users\cborel\Documents\EMToolkit\BLEngine\config_local.cfg for versioning convenience

```

Once the command is executed, a complete set of configuration files is created. This includes the main configuration file along with a local configuration files and a set of nvm_infos files.
