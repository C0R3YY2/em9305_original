## Version 1.6

**Date:** 2023-09-26

This version fixes some features from the 1.5 version and add some new features.

### Breaking Changes

-


### JSON-based configurations files

To allow flexibiliy and confidentiality for devices development and distribution of blengine, the NVM informations have been moved to JSON files. 

Thoses files are needed for ihex programming, this requirement should be removed in a futur release.
They are needed for NVM informations write and read actions.

To limit the change, the blengine distribution and pip package will ship with default NVM informations files, targeting the EM9305.

Please see NVM Infmations page in the BLEngine wiki for more information

see Pull Request !2863

### REPL CLI Mode

Read-Eval-Print-Loop mode is now production ready !

Give it a quick try with `blengine --port=COM22 repl` then ask for `help`

### Dev Ops

New pipeline and new tst_suite with a lot of improvements, much more stable now.

The PIP server now offer latest release by default and beta versions on demand.

### Packets update

- Many fixes concerning packets definitions







## Version 1.5

**Date:** 2023-01-16

This update bring new features and a few bugfixes.

### Better Device and NVM configuration and management

Support JSON-based configurations files support for mapping NVM memory and IHEX files.

Now blengine have product specific and local configurations files for devices, and a general configuration repository for reference. This allow flexibiliy and confidentiality for development of devices and distribution of blengine.

Please see Doc NVM Infmations page in the BLEngine wiki for more information

see Pull Request !2863

### Product LifeCycle support

*New* procedures `restart` and `power_cycle` allow to restart the device to a predifined mode.

see Pull Request !3388

### Firmware header support

A basic firmware header decoding is now available through a simple procedure

You can use this either on a device or on a ihex file, but you need a connectable device.

see Pull Request !3486

## Version 1.2.6

**Date:** 2021-04-28

### Breaking Changes

**9305 and 9304 Support**

TL;DR: If you’re developing for 9304, you must add `--model=EM9304` in CLI or `engine.device_model=EM9304` before sending a packet.

Since the EMSystem Host Interface Packets should work with 9305 and 9304, an HCIEngine (default engine in CLI mode) can be used for 9304 and 9305, the default is 9305 mode the 9304 support can be enabled by wither of thw following option:

In a Script, set `engine.device_model=EM9304` just after creation, it’s also an optional constructor argument (`engine(transport, device_model=EM9304)`).

In CLI mode, add the `--model=EM9304` option before a `send` or `run` command.

But what is really doing this flag, you may ask ?
In case of sending a EmPacket (Host Interface) or an EM9305Command (for Unity support) it change the default encode wrapper to `packets.EMcommands.Public_User_Defined_1` ehich is the complicated one for the 9304. Concerning the events packets, they are all registered for the 9304 or 9305.

\*\* Logger module \*\*

TL;DR:
You cannot call logger.init() without arguments, you must give a name to the default logger.

The signature of the logger.init() is the following `def init(name, cfg_file=None, screen=True)`. By default `screen` is True which will log WARNING and above level messages to stdout.

If you want to attach the blengine logger to your’s just call init with the same name as your predefined logger.

### Features
* Added a –port option to the CLI, this bypass any config file and connect with the default serial config (115200,8,0,0). #1212

* Procedures return values are standardized as single boolean or/and a second argument which may be a string message. #1250

* Dynamic change support between 9304 and 9305, also add a CLI flag (see breaking changes). #1301

* NVM Cycling Control new command. #1584

* A procedure can now be registered with the @procedure decorator. #1200

* A DeviceTestEngine class is now available for 9304 testing. #1649

* The logger module have been refactored to be more flexible. #1576

* In CLI mode, a string which begin with 0x is now interpreted as a bytearray. #1270
