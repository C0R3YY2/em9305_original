# Introduction

The concept behind BLEngine is to have a common ground to build different applications. BLEngine is a communication library that can either be used in standalone mode (command line), used in a script, or integrated in a GUI application.
Its purpose is to replace the tools developed for EM9304 that require maintenance and updates to support EM9305 requirements.

BLEngine has been developed with future evolutions AND backward compatibility in mind. BLEngine is based on HCI transport as defined in the Bluetooth Core Specification. The EM9305 vendor commands have been redefined for better flexibility in the future, but the EM9304 vendor commands are still supported.

This library is the core of `blengine_cli` project and `blengine_gui` project. Moreover, itâ€™s also widely used for testing.
