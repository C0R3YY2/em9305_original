Overview
--------

This section provides technical information on the security libraries available in the device’s ROM.
It lists the API that can be used by the end user application to implement security related operations for each of the
available algorithm and also provides a comprehensive technical documentation in PDF form.
Since all security related functions are located in the device’s ROM, there is no need for an end user application
to embeds its own security functions, leading to a smaller application size.
