    * EMSRC_Start_ADV_Pattern starts advertising immediately after the command is received.

* **Build system:**

  * Add IMAGE_CRC_CHECK cmake variable to deactivate the firmware CRC check.
  * Remove unnecessary parts in the Cmake files.

* **Examples:**

  * Fix the EM Data Transfer service example: remove printf from the BLE host stack callbacks to avoid deadlocks due to the non-reentrant printf library.
  * Move GPIO_EnableJtag4Wires() to NVM_ConfigModules() to allow using Metaware Debugger when PmlJtag4wEn and PmlJtag2wEn are set to 0 in info pages.
  * Example of ADC Driver in continuous mode using DMA
  * Bluetooth Link Layer Controller over USB example
  * Bluetooth HID (Mouse / Keyboard) Device Application
  * Bluetooth HID Client as USB Dongle Application
  * I2C Master example application to read/write EEPROM

* **Documentation:**

  * Documentation general improvement

Tools
^^^^^

* **BLEngine 1.4**

  * See dedicated release notes for additional information.
  * Note that the script program_nvm_main.py is deprecated. It is recommended to use the built-in BLEngine procedure emsystem_prog.

* **Lifecycle_Ctrl v1.2**

  * Includes a set of commands to assist production and development

* **Build Toolchain**

  * new tool to handle firmware header (headerstuffer.exe)


Licenses
^^^^^^^^

* SDK Software License Agreement update


Known limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Radio control commands**

* EMSRC Set RF Activity (0xFCC3) command returns unknown HCI command error from the nvm_emb_controller firmware.
* EMSRC Set Receiver Test End (0xFCC6) command returns invalid Average RSSI (255).

**Current profile**

* At reset, the current profile shows a higher consumption than the regular values listed in the datasheet
  during the first 200 ms after the device start-up in both step-down and in voltage multiplier modes.
  However, this behavior does not happen when resuming from a sleep period. The device start-up power
  consumption will be optimized.


v1.0 (Internal)
---------------

Improvements / Fix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Build flow**

  * Support for DI03 added
  * Support for DI02 removed
  * Support for EM-Core V1.0.0 (see dedicated section)

* **Drivers:**

  * Radio

    * Robustness improvements (Frequent CRC Error identified which was due to turning the radio OFF too early)
  * UART

    * Bug fixed in RX/TX when speed was set to either 1200 or 2400 bauds.
  * Sleep Manager and Power Management Logic

    * Power consumption improvement: LF RC Calibration sequence
  * Power Management Logic

    * New bit field definition added to detect CRC error to support failsafe firmware update
  * Documentation update in all drivers

* **EM-Core V1.0.0**

  * Support for EMSRC Transmitter (0xFCC1) and Receiver (0xFCC5) Tests (Supports limited DTM packet function and Continuous Modulation operations)
  * Support for EMCore versioning (ability to build an application for an older EM-Core version)
  * All improvements and bug fixes done in the drivers listed above

* **Examples:**

  * EM Data Transfer Server sample application to show how to create custom GATT-based services.
