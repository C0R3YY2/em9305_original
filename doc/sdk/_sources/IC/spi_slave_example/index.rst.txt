SPI Slave Example
=========================================================================


Overview
--------

The purpose of this example is to show how to use the SPI slave driver.

This example prints over UART each byte received from SPI slave.
To achieve the synchronization between the EM9305 and the SPI master device,
a GPIO is used as a chip select (CS) signal. It is used to wake up the EM9305
when in sleep mode while the SPI master needs to send data.

GPIOs used:

* UART TX on GPIO 7
* SPIM CSN on GPIO 11
* SPIM SCK on GPIO 8
* SPIM MISO on GPIO 9
* SPIM MOSI on GPIO 10

The output is on GPIO7. You can connect a USB to UART device to GPIO7 and use a terminal (for example docklight) to connect on the COM port of your device.

.. warning::

  Double check you connected the jumpers D+(07) and D-(06) on the DVK.
  The GPIO6 and GPIO7 pins are connected by default to the USB connector.

The output of this example on GPIO7 should look like this (ASCII):

.. code-block:: bash

  EM9305 SPI Slave demo. Starting...
  SPIS data received: 0x0b

.. note::
  The JTAG can't be used because the SPI slave is on GPIOs 8-11.


Build
-----

The build target of this example is: **spi_slave_example**

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target spi_slave_example


Run
---

To program and run the example:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\spi_slave_example\spi_slave_example.ihex --progress

With YY = the COM port number of your DVK.

You should be able to see the messages on your terminal.
