Change Log
==========

Version 4.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Integrate EM HW API driver v1.0.0
  * Integrate Radio driver v0.9.0
  * Integrate NVM driver v0.3.1

Version 4.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Integrate Radio driver version 0.8.0
  * Integrate PML driver version 0.6.0
  * EM-Core versioning is aligned with SDK version


Version 3.5.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Ensure EMSRC_ReceiverTestEnd sends the correct information when the receiver test has not been initiated.
  * Integrate em_hw_api driver version 0.2.0
  * Integrate QPC driver version 0.2.0
  * Integrate PML driver version 0.6.0
  * Integrate Radio driver version 0.7

Version 3.4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * PR6458 - Enable division by zero exception durig wakeup and power on reset (POR).

Version 3.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Radio transmitter control improvement for power consumption optimization
  * Power consumption improvement (Tx pulse)
  * CTE functions moved to AoA / AoD library for direction finding
  * Set Rx Max PDU length (BLE Audio fix for BIS)

Version 3.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Add support for di05
  * Improve the previous fix regarding STATUS content when task switching in QP/C by setting or retaining only required bits U, DZ, SC, AD and US according to compilation definitions.
  * Radio:

    * Fix +8 and +10 dBm RF Output Power

Version 2.6.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Bug fix in Transmitter Test command

    * Return an error when packet length overtake the maximum allowed size for test packets in DTM mode only.

  * Improvement of Transmitter and Receiver Tests:

    * Add parameter check for the lower boundaries
    * Radio driver initialization done only once during EM-Core initialization

  * Restoring full STATUS content when task switching in QP/C. With this new version, all the bits keep their former values during task switching under QP/C control.
  * PML Driver: Adjust the SCDB Mode Multiplier to double when the supply goes from 1.5 to 1.1v to avoid Brownout reset.
  * Fix RSSI value computation in Direct Test Mode (DTM)
  * DI04 support added
  * Introduction of the standard version of EM-Core
  * Enabling pull-down configuration on GPIO6 & GPIO7
  * Fix packet error rate (PER) problem in EM-Core Radio test RX command.
  * Improvement of Radio configuration robustness with respect to HF-XTAL switching
  * Fix a power consumption issue in Step Down power mode
  * EM-Core includes new test commands used at wafer level.

    * EMSS_LE_Decrypt, EMSS_LE_Decrypt_KC and EMSS_Encrypt_KC (Key Container).
    * EMSMM_Read_At_Address and EMSMM_Write_At_Address available in EM-Core for production purpose.
    * EMSG_Set_Sleep_Options command available in EM-Core for production purpose.

  * EM-Core Radio Test commands have also been updated to improve wafer test sequence.

    * EMSRC_Start_ADV_Pattern starts advertising immediately after the command is received.

  * EM-Core is available in legacy form and also with the no_crc_check option.

Version 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Initial Version
