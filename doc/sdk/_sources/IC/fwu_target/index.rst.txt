FWU Target Example
=========================================================================


Overview
--------

This sample application is used to demonstrate the Firmware Update feature that is part of this SDK.

.. note::

  This sample application is intended to be executed on a DVK where the SPI slave of the EM9305 is managed by the EM Transport interface.

  If for any reason the SPI Slave of the EM9305 is used for other purposes, the EM Transport Manager must be disabled from the sample application.

  To disable the EM Transport Manager, remove the calls to EMTransportManager_InitWithSleepCB, EMTransportManager_SendEvent and EMTransportManager_Resume functions from the NVM_ApplicationEntry function defined in nvm_main.c.

  EM Transport Manager must also be disabled from the firmware_updater sample applications.

Build
-----

This sample application generates two targets: **fwu_target** and **fwu_target_v2**.

When **fwu_target** is executed, the FWU Target becomes connectable and starts advertising with the Complete Local Name set to "FWU Target".

When **fwu_target_v2** is executed, the FWU Target becomes connectable and starts advertising with the Complete Local Name set to "FWU Target V2".

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target fwu_target
  cmake --build . --target fwu_target_v2
