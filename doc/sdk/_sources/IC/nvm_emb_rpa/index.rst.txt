Resolvable Private Address (RPA) example
=========================================================================

Overview
--------

This example is designed to demostrate RPA functionality with device in peripheral role supporting connections, pairing, and security.
The application begins by advertising its identity address. After bonding, it advertises using an RPA (Resolvable Private Address). 
The peripheral automatically requests the central to initiate bonding. Only one device is stored in the bonding database at a time.

.. note::
   Some versions of Android show the pairing dialog twice. This is due to a problem in Android when handling SMP Security Requests from a peripheral.

Build
-----

The build target of this example is: **nvm_emb_rpa**

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target nvm_emb_rpa

Program and Run
---------------

To program and run the example:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\nvm_emb_rpa\nvm_emb_rpa.ihex --progress

With YY = the COM port number of your DVK (optional if you set it in the file ``<sdk>\tools\blengine\config.cfg``), and

Erase the Bonding Database
--------------------------

To erase the bonding database in NVM:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY send DVK_TARGET_HARD_RESET --mode=1
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY send EMSMM_NVM_ERASE_PAGE --Area=1 --Page=1

Test
----

Program the firmware on a test device (DUT) in the `Run` step above. The DUT
will immediately start connectable advertising using a complete local name
as `EM9305_RPA`. Using a smartphone with the nrf connect app, the DUT
can be seen in the scanner tab in the image below.

The peer device can scan this device as shown in the image below,

After a connection is made user can request for bonding.

At this point the central may initiate just works pairing with the DUT.

Discovered services can be refreshed.

At this point, if the devices are disconnected, the DUT will use an RPA when
advertising again. Only the device who has the IRK exchanged during pairing is
able to resolve the DUT's address. By default, the RPA will refresh every 5
minutes providing privacy against tracking by Bluetooth address.
