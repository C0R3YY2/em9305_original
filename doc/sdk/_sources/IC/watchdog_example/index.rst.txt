Watchdog Example
================================================================================


Overview
--------

The purpose of this example is to show how to use the watchdog driver.

The watchdog timer is configured with a period of 5 seconds and started in the
function *NVM_ConfigModules*. A timer is configured to print a counter value
every second over UART. After 10 seconds, this example simulates a software
issue with an infinite loop.

When the watchdog timer times out, it reset the device and the application
restarts. The application detects if the reset was due to the watchdog timer and
changes the start-up message printed over UART accordingly.

.. note::

  The watchdog timer is reset in the function *QK_onIdleExt* in case the device
  cannot go to sleep mode or if the automatic sleep mode is disabled.

The UART output is on GPIO7. You can connect a USB to UART device to GPIO7 and
use a terminal to connect on the COM port of your device. The output of this
example should be:

.. code-block:: bash

Run
---

To program and run the example:

.. code-block:: bash
