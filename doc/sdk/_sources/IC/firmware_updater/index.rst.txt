Firmware Updater Example
=========================================================================

Overview
--------

This sample application is used to demonstrate the Firmware Update feature that is part of this SDK.
Refer to the `Firmware Update <../../sections/FirmwareUpdate.html>`_ section of the SDK Documentation for additional information on the firmware update functionality.

The Firmware Updater application is a special application that is mapped at the end of the NVM. When it gets control (i.e. when it is executed), its main goal is to update the application (e.g., `FWU_Target <../fwu_target/index.html>`_), `EM-Core <../emcore/index.html>`_  or to update any other firmware image located in the NVM except itself.

.. note::

  This sample application is intended to be executed on a DVK where the SPI slave of the EM9305 is managed by the EM Transport interface.

  If for any reason the SPI Slave of the EM9305 is used for other purposes, the EM Transport Manager must be disabled from the sample application.

  To disable the EM Transport Manager, remove the calls to EMTransportManager_InitWithSleepCB, EMTransportManager_SendEvent and EMTransportManager_Resume functions from the NVM_ApplicationEntry function defined in nvm_main.c.

  EM Transport Manager must also be disabled from the nvm_fwu_target sample applications.

Build
-----

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target firmware_updater


Program
-------

To program and execute the example, follow these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\firmware_updater\firmware_updater.ihex --progress

.. note::

  In all cases, the beginning of the NVM shall be programmed with the `NVM_Bootloader` image which is responsible for properly starting the selected firmware image. If not already done, such firmware shall be programmed first is programmed using the following command line:

  .. code-block:: bash

    cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
    python blengine_cli.py --port COMXX run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\nvm_bootloader\nvm_bootloader_base.ihex

  Once done, the `firmware_updater.ihex` image can be programmed.
