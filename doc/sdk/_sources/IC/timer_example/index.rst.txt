Timer Example
=========================================================================


Overview
--------

The purpose of these examples is to show how to use the timer library (unitimer driver).

The oneshot example toggles GPI06 to high and start a oneshot timer. Once the timer is expired the callback toggles the GPI06 to low. Then, the example waits 1 second before restarting the previous sequence.

The expresso example follows the same sequence as the first example except that it uses an expresso timer.

The periodic example toggles GPIO6 and GPIO7 by using 2 periodic timers. Both GPIO6 and GPIO7 are output. The first timer callback is called every 100 ms (10Hz).
The second timer callback is called every 500 ms (2Hz). This example put the CPU in sleep mode between the calls of the timer callbacks.

To see the GPIOs toggling, you will need a logic analyzer or an oscilloscope connected to GPIO6 and GPIO7.

.. warning::

  Double check you connected the jumpers D+(07) and D-(06) on the DVK.
  The GPIO6 and GPIO7 pins are connected by default to the USB connector.


Build
-----

The build targets of these examples are: **timer_example_oneshot**, **timer_example_expresso** and **timer_example_periodic**

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target timer_example_oneshot
  cmake --build . --target timer_example_expresso
  cmake --build . --target timer_example_periodic


Run
---

To program and run the example:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\timer_example\timer_example_oneshot.ihex --progress

With YY = the COM port number of your DVK.
