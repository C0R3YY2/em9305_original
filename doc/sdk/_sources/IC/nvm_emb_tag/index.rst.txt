TagConnected example
=========================================================================


Overview
--------

This example is starting the BLE stack and implements a Tag application. Optionally, ``#define TAG_USE_RPA`` for the device to use a Resolvable Private Address (RPA) after pairing.

Available profiles in this example:

* Link Loss Service
* Alert Service
* Tx Power Service

.. warning::

    This application has configurable SMP parameters `smpCfg_t` where `minKeyLen` can be specified. Reducing this value from 16 to 7 (minimum) reduces the entropy of the encryption key making the device less secure.

Build
-----

The build target of this example is: **nvm_emb_tag**

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\build
  cmake --build . --target nvm_emb_tag


Program
-------

To program and run the example:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd <sdk>\tools\blengine
  python blengine_cli.py --port COMYY run emsystem_prog ..\..\build\projects\nvm_emb_tag\nvm_emb_tag.ihex --progress

With YY = the COM port number of your DVK (optional if you set it in the file ``<sdk>\tools\blengine\config.cfg``), and 
XX = the design iteration identifier.


Test
----

To connect to the device, you need a smartphone with a BLE app installed. Typically, the LightBlue application is used for the rest of this page.

When installed, open the application and start a BLE scan.
Find your device which name should be 'EM9305_TAG'.

The following picture is filtered to show the TAG beacon using the LightBlue application.

Click on CONNECT to connect to the device. If you ``#define TAG_USE_RPA``, accept the pairing request.
When connected, you can read some device informations and services.

Once connected, scroll down until you see the link loss service and expand the selection.

Once connected, scroll down until you see the immediate alert service and expand the selection.

Once connected, scroll down until you see the Tx power service and expand the selection.

After disconnecting, if you chose to pair, your device will restart advertising with an RPA that changes according to interval defined by ``RPA_TIMEOUT_SEC``. Only devices that have the IRK are able to resolve the identity, preventing tracking by Bluetooth address. Reset the 9305 to clear the locally stored bonding data.
