Change Log
------------

Version 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * PR 9111: Radio driver optimization when RF output power is applied for improved performances. Added bool returned type for following functions:

               - `bool PML_UpdateDCDC(void);`
               - `bool PML_SetDcdcTimingConst(â€¦);`
    * PR 9252: Reduce the minimum sleep time to 3 ms.
    * PR 9274: Change the default value of the calibration correction factor (`gPML_Config.rcCalibCorrection`) to -105ppm to account for the change in LF-RC frequency between active and sleep modes.
    * PR 9275: Set default sleep clock accuracy (SCA) value to 250 ppm with LF-RC and to 150 ppm with LF-XTAL.

Version 0.6.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The switched capacitor doubler (SCDB) is now permanently activated to enhance system robustness in Voltage Multiplier Mode across the entire voltage range.

Version 0.6.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added support for configuring DCDC timings for 2.2uH coil.

Version 0.5.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chores:

* [MOD] Cleaning
* [FIX] Source clean
* IRQHandler_PmlClock(void) removed for test targets

Fixes:

* [MOD] RF_FpgaConfigXtalOsc is now weak to avoid issues when compile
* safe register access
* fix issue in test case (test_rom_pml_power)
* flint error
* Use the original PML Reset Flags for the new ROM
* Init_n setting and voltage doubler initial value (bug 3731 and 5174)
* PML unit tests run in ROM repo
* Fix ROM bugs 3728 and 3729
* Set VBAT1 comparator level to 1.9V in step up mode

Features:

* DRAM retention during deep sleep
* Dynamic memory allocation in EM Transport and EM System
* Number of transport buffers increased
* PML simulation test cases ported to unity
* Test targets added in the test unity package
* Support of Deep Sleep Mode with and without DRAM retention
* Single transport and GPIO libraries & No Device Monitor
* add boot mode switching API

Version 0.4.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Functions for setting and getting the LDO levels (VCC and dig) are now inline functions.


Version 0.4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reorganization of the PML driver:

* Removed rom_pml.h and pml_shared.h header files. The content of those files were moved to pml.h.
* Some function prototypes related to module initialization were removed from public header files.


Version 0.3.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [ADD] LF clock calibration result correction added to improve timing.


Version 0.3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [FIX] Fixed an issue in the calculation of the wake-up time when the protocol timer divider != 1.


Version 0.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [FIX] Voltage Doubler PWM value set to default value before going to Sleep mode to reduce peak current when resuming from Sleep mode.


Version 0.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Merge documentation for PML, PML Power Management, and PML Voltage Monitor.
* [FIX] System clock switched to 24MHz before going to sleep mode.
* [FIX] DCDC parameters updated for step-down mode using 4.7uH coil.


Version 0.1.2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Updated doxygen comments.
* Cleaned the driver.


Version 0.1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [FIX] VCC charging disabled in sleep mode.
* [FIX] DCDC parameters updated for RF RX mode in step-down power mode.
* [FIX] LDO used for 3dBm RF power with voltages < 1.9V in step-down mode.
* [FIX] Modified the voltage limits for 6dBm and 3dBm in step-down mode.
* [FIX] Update the switch cap doubler mode when SVLD interrupt occurs in external-up mode.


Version 0.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Initial Version.
